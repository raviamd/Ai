# A Search Algorithm - Short Answer:*
# A* is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that is used to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node. It combines features of both Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search by using a heuristic function to guide the search.
# Key Formula:
# A* uses the evaluation function:
# f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
# where:
# g(n) = cost from the start node to node n.
# h(n) = heuristic estimate of the cost from node n to the goal.
# Steps:
# Start with the initial node, and calculate f(n) for its neighbors.
# Expand the node with the lowest f(n).
# Continue expanding nodes with the lowest f(n) until the goal is reached.
# Use Case: A* is commonly used in pathfinding problems, such as in navigation systems, robotics, and games.
